# foneOS [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/wercker/ci/foneOS/foneOS.svg)](https://app.wercker.com/foneOS/foneOS)

A simple phone "operating system", designed to run on the Intel Edison.

Technically, this is *not* an operating system due to the fact that it runs on top of Linux (or your desktop OS, if using the simulator), so it does not handle low-level tasks.

## Features
* Basic GUI/layout system
* TrueType font support
* Basic settings page
* Basic dialer
* Simulator 
* App support (using LuaJIT)
* Can run on actual hardware

### Note on apps
It may seem like there are lots of applications missing. This is because they must be downloaded separately. You can find foneOS apps at the [foneOS organization page](https://github.com/foneOS).

## Hardware
FoneOS currently supports the following hardware:
### On computer
* A simulated touch screen (240x320, powered by SDL)
* A simulated modem that can't really do anything

### On [Intel Edison (with Arduino breakout)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13097)
#### Modems
* [Adafruit FONA 800 (SIM800)](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1946)

#### Displays
* [SeeedStudio 2.8" TFT Touch Shield v1 (ST8891R)](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/28-tft-touch-shield-p-864.html)
* [Adafruit 2.8" TFT Touch Shield for Arduino with Capacitive Touch Screen (ILI9341)](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1947)

#### Touch screens
* [SeeedStudio 2.8" TFT Touch Shield v1 (4-wire generic resistive)](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/28-tft-touch-shield-p-864.html)
* [Adafruit 2.8" TFT Touch Shield for Arduino with Capacitive Touch Screen (FT6206)](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1947)

Note that while foneOS has been tested working on the Intel Edison, it should technically probably maybe work on anything that supports MRAA, assuming you wire everything correctly.

## Dependencies
### For all builds
* freetype2
* SQLite
* LuaJIT

#### Already included (no additional download required)
* pugixml

### For simulator builds
* SDL2

### For non-simulated builds
* [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa)
